To fill in refers to completing various parts of a form, while to fill out refers to completing a form as one whole item. Examples: Every prospective employee must fill out an application by giving name, address, previous jobs, etc. The teenager had some trouble filling the forms out by himself, so his mother helped him.

</s><break strength="none" time="2s" /></p><p><s>to assemble (S)</s><break strength="none" time="4s" /><s>"to put together. Comment: A noun or pronoun usually divides this idiom. The preposition back is used when something has been disassembled and then is being reassembled, as in the second example.
