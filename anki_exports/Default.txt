modern, current, timely	up to date. Comment: Hyphens (-) separate the parts of this idiom when it precedes a noun form, as in the third example. The verb to update derives from this idiom. Examples: The president insisted that the company bring its aging equipment up to date. This catalog is not up to date. It was published several years ago. The news program gave an up-to-date account of the nuclear accident. The newscaster said that he would update the news report every half hour.

The elevator broke down, so we walked all the way up to the top floor.

to have the desire to, to want to consider	"to feel like. Comment: This idiom is usually followed by a gerund (the -ing form of a verb used as a noun). Examples: I don't feel like studying tonight. Let's go to a basketball game. I feel like taking a long walk. Would you like to go with me?"
